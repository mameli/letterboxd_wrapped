# Letterboxd Wrapped Analysis

![](imgs/letterboxd.png)
Why pay $20 for a personalized Letterboxd Wrapped when you can leverage your skills and spend 20 hours creating a similar analysis yourself? While some might argue it's a waste of time (and they're right), the joy of discovery often outweighs convenience.

This repository contains a proof of concept (POC) for recreating Letterboxd Wrapped using tools available to any tech-savvy user.

## What is Letterboxd?

[Letterboxd](https://letterboxd.com/) is a social media platform for movie enthusiasts where users can log, rate, and review the films they've watched. Every year, Letterboxd releases a "wrapped" feature, similar to Spotify Wrapped, aggregating your account's most interesting data.

## Project Highlights

Initially, the goal was to create a Jupyter notebook to compute these results. However, after discovering this [post by one of Marimo's founders](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/akshayka_marimo-notebooks-query-polars-dataframes-activity-7279937560934526976-fZqG?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop), the analysis quickly evolved into a fully interactive app.

### Why Marimo?

Marimo is a powerful framework for creating prototypes quickly, offering features such as:
- Exporting notebooks to various formats, including WebAssembly (WASM).
- Deploying projects effortlessly via [GitHub Pages](https://github.com/marimo-team/marimo-gh-pages-template).

With Marimo, the analysis notebook transforms into a fully interactive app, allowing users to adjust values, input files, and more.

## Pros and Cons of Using Marimo

### Pros:
- **Rapid Prototyping:** Marimo simplifies the development of interactive Python prototypes.
- **Modern Stack Integration:** Works seamlessly with UV, Polars, and DuckDB for efficient data analysis.

### Cons:
- **Load Times:** Each access requires downloading Python dependencies, resulting in slow load times.
- **Library Integration Issues:** Some libraries, like Matplotlib, don't integrate smoothly, necessitating alternatives such as Plotly.

## Technologies Used

- **Python Libraries:** Polars, Plotly
- **Framework:** Marimo
- **Deployment:** GitHub Pages
